                    <h1>Welcome to the Styx Express!</h1>
                    <p>hi! my name is Ray! I'm currently a junior at Norfolk Acadmy(a highschool in Virginia). My goal is to see more beauty in life. 
                        As for the name of this website, it's just one of my many aliases online, and github pages wants me to use my username as the name of the website.
                        But maybe there is a meaning. Aren't we all headed towards death, floating down the river Styx? Some drift along faster, some slower, some resist the current, 
                        others let it take them away. So maybe the styx express is just life itself. Perhaps the flow of the river is the flow of time. Welcome aboard the Styx Express...
                        Anyway, here are some of my interests:</p>

                <p>Right now, this website is still in development, but I hope to post some blogs/papers/essays here as well as updates on a videogame that I am making, which I may migrate to an itch.io page</p>
